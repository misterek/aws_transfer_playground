AWS Transfer is both kinda cool, and kinda a huge pain in the ass.

It's cool because it allows you to quickly setup an SFTP server that you can
use to transfer files to and from.

It sucks because they don't handle usernames or passwords in a very good way.

This repo will just be me playing around with a few things.  Setting it up via terraform, which is pretty easy, but maybe also figuring out the best way to handle username/password if needed. I may also play around with allowing an application to manage the keys and maybe passwords.


Or maybe I'll get bored.  We'll see!
